 * @class Convert
 * @brief Processes FASTA files, converting DNA sequences into a compact bit vector.
 *
 * This class reads DNA sequences from a FASTA file in two passes.
 * 1. The first pass calculates the total number of reads and total
 * nucleotide count to reserve memory efficiently.
 * 2. The second pass converts each nucleotide into a 2-bit representation
 * (A=00, C=10, G=01, T=11), and stores the result in a single,
 * continuous std::vector<bool>.
 *
 * It also tracks the cumulative end position (in bits) of each read.
